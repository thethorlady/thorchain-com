intro:
  title: "THORChain とは?"
  header: "Decentralized, anonymous, oracle-free bridge between blockchains"
  subheader: "THORChain is a groundbreaking technology that allows for fully decentralized swaps between any supported blockchain, and earns yield from native assets."

      title: "Impermanent Loss Protection"
      $0: "THORChain will insure liquidity providers against impermanent loss."
    $1:
      title: "高利回り"
      $0: "The design of the network ruthlessly maximizes revenue for liquidity providers and node operators."
    $2:
      title: "ネットワーク効果"
      $0: "The network is run by dozens of anonymous node operators who bond RUNE to secure liquidity in pools and are rewarded for their services. Attempting to fork and bootstrap a clone would be a difficult task to achieve."
    $3:
      title: "資産が上がる"
      $0: "RUNE is required to be paired as a settlement asset 1:1 in pools. But the network's economic design causes the value of RUNE to increase with liquidity depth."
stats:
  title: "THORChain STATS"
  header: "Trust numbers, not promises"
  subheader: "The THORChain protocol is totally transparent -- you can verify its solvency for yourself. View the nodes that run the network, the vaults that they host, and the total value locked in the network."
tools:
  title: "THORChain TOOLS"
  header: "Community-driven development"
  subheader: "The THORChain project is made up of a team of core developers, but is augmented by a enormous community that has built various tools that provide resources for the community."

      subheader: "Visualize liquidity positions, rewards, and total percent gain versus holding."
economy:
  title: "THORCHAIN ECONOMY"
  header: "A network asset that accrues protocol value"
  subheader: "The RUNE network asset plays a crucial role in the THORChain ecosystem. It's not a governence token -- it's the settlement asset that enables liquidity across pairs, and is bonded to secure the network."
  content:
    $0:
      title: "Incentive Pendulum"
      $0: "A balance between bonded and pooled RUNE is key to a secure and liquid network. If the network is under-bonded, node operators are incentivized to increase their bonds, if it’s over-bonded, liquidity providers are incentivized to pool more assets."
    $1:
      title: "Deterministic Token Value"
      $0: "The price of RUNE is deterministic — since the network requires it to be bonded 2:1 by node operators, and paired 1:1 with pooled assets by liquidity providers, the market cap of RUNE is at least 3x TVL of non-RUNE assets."
    $2:
      title: "High Yield"
      $0: "The combination of the various economic incentives result in a network that produces high APY for both node operators and liquidity providers."
    $3:
      title: "Slip-Based Fee"
      $0: "A liquidity-sensitive slip-based fee solves many issues — including bootstrapping shallow pools, discouraging dust and sandwich attacks, and forcing high volume/frequency traders to pay their fair share."
    $4:
      title: "Continuous Liquitity Pools"
      $0: "The use of a CLP allows for many benefits, such as the ability to sense prices without an oracle. Simply by knowing the asset depth in pools, the network is able to determine price while arbitrageurs ensure the rate is inline with current market conditions."
    $5:
      title: "Verifiable Solvency"
      $0: "The value locked in bond, vaults, and pools is easily verified. Node operators could steal from a value they host, but they would loose their bond — which is worth much more than the vault. View the list of nodes and pools."
roadmap:
  title: "ROADMAP & PLANS"
  header: "Cross chain swaps are just the beginning"
  subheader: "At its core, THORChain is a cross-chain liquidity network. But the design of the protocol enables much more than just swaps -- synths, composites, self-paying loans -- anything is possible."
  content:
    released:
      title: "Released"
      $0: "Binance Chain Chaosnet is currently live on BEPSwap. This network is single-chain and allows users to trade and pool BNB assets. It will be depreciated with the release of multi-chain chaosnet."
      $1: "Multi-Chain Testnet is currently live at ASGARDEX. This is the pre-release cross-chain network that allows users to swap native testnet assets across chains."
    upcoming:
      title: "Upcoming"
      $0: "Multi-Chain Chaosnet is imminent. MCCN is the culmunation of years of development effort, and will be the first working decentralized cross-chain liquidity network to exist."
      $1: "Multi-Chain Mainnet will be announced once Chaosnet has been deemed stable."
    future:
      title: "Future"
      $0: "Many future features are in the planning stages, including a suite of "ThorFi" products including the following:"
